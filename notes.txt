https://aeon.co/essays/how-empathy-and-creativity-can-re-humanise-videoconferencing

humans are defined by their entanglement with the world
academia, a balance of order and chaos
calm technology – the extent to which a technology works so well, fits so perfectly with human needs and habits, that it disappears from view
Build in tactile feedback
There’s something plain weird about a wall of faces staring out of the screen. That’s a blocker to empathy
That’s how designing works: incremental improvements based on insights drawn from experience.
