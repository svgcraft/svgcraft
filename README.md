## svgcraft

Real-time collaborative SVG graphics development in the browser, in a playful way.

### Usage

Tested only on Chrome 80.

Due to CORS, some resources cannot be loaded using the `file://` protocol, so you have to set up a local server by running

```
python3 -m http.server
```

in this directory, and then go to http://0.0.0.0:8000/gen_urls.html
