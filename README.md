Develop SVG graphics in your browser in a playful way.

### Usage

Tested only on Chrome 80.

Uses ES6 modules, which cannot be loaded using the `file://` protocol, so you have to set up a local server by running

```
python3 -m http.server
```

in this directory, and then go to one of the example htmls, eg http://0.0.0.0:8000/archipelago.html.
